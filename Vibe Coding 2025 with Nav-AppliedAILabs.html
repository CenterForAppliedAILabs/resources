    </table>
    <p class="note">Note: The above table summarizes the most prominent vibe coding platforms as of late 2025. Details such as free tier limits, export options, and integration capabilities are subject to change as platforms evolve. Always verify with the official documentation before making critical project decisions.</p>

    <h2 id="free-tier">1. Free Tier Monthly Refreshes: Credits and Tokens</h2>
    <p>The free tier refresh model is a defining feature of vibe coding tools, directly impacting accessibility, experimentation, and project planning. Most platforms employ either a credit-based or token-based system, with daily or monthly refreshes. The specifics vary widely:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Lovable:</span> Free users receive 5 daily credits, up to a maximum of 30 per month. Credits refresh daily, but unused daily credits do not roll over. Paid plans offer higher monthly credits and rollover for unused credits. Each prompt or action consumes credits based on complexity, with simple edits costing less than 1 credit and complex tasks (e.g., image generation) costing more. This model encourages careful prompt crafting and limits heavy experimentation on the free tier.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Bolt:</span> The free plan provides 300,000 tokens per day and 1 million tokens per month. Tokens refresh daily and monthly, supporting substantial usage for prototyping and learning. Paid plans start at 10 million tokens/month, with rollover for unused tokens on paid tiers. Tokens are consumed based on the volume of text processed, so larger projects or more complex requests use more tokens.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Hostinger Horizons:</span> Offers a 7-day free trial with 5 free messages total. There is no ongoing free plan; after the trial, users must subscribe to a paid plan. Paid plans provide monthly credits (30–400/month), which refresh at the start of each billing cycle. The Explorer plan (cheapest) does not allow credit top-ups; higher tiers do.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Base44:</span> The free plan grants 25 message credits per month (max 5 per day) and 500 integration credits. Credits refresh monthly, with daily caps to prevent rapid depletion. Paid plans increase both message and integration credits, but there is no pay-as-you-go or top-up option—users must upgrade to a higher tier if they exceed limits.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Replit:</span> Free users are limited by resource quotas (CPU, memory, execution time) rather than explicit credit or token counts. The free plan allows up to 1,200 minutes of development time per month. There is no fixed daily or monthly token limit, but heavy usage may result in throttling or queuing. Paid plans offer more generous resource allocations and priority access.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">v0 (Vercel):</span> The free plan currently has no stated daily usage limits for basic generation tasks, making it highly accessible for rapid prototyping. However, advanced features or higher-tier AI models may incur additional costs or require a paid plan. Users receive a daily bonus of $2 in credits on paid plans, and effort-based billing applies for complex requests.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Analysis:</span> The diversity in free tier refresh models reflects the platforms' target audiences and business strategies. Lovable and Base44 favor monthly caps with daily limits to encourage regular engagement and prevent abuse, while Bolt and v0 offer more generous, token-based systems suited for developers and power users. Hostinger Horizons stands out for its trial-only approach, which, while limiting ongoing free access, ensures users experience the full feature set before committing. For sustained, hobbyist, or educational use, Bolt and v0 provide the most flexibility, whereas Lovable and Base44 are better for light, controlled experimentation.</p>

    <h2 id="hosting">2. Backend Hosting Services</h2>
    <p>Backend hosting is a critical differentiator among vibe coding tools, determining whether users can deploy full-stack applications without external integrations. The platforms vary in their approach:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Lovable:</span> Offers Lovable Cloud (built-in backend hosting) and supports integration with Supabase for database, authentication, and storage. Users can choose between the native backend or third-party services, providing flexibility for both rapid deployment and future migration. However, backend export is not fully supported—users must set up their own environment variables and backend services when self-hosting exported code.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Bolt:</span> Provides Bolt Cloud with enterprise-grade backend infrastructure, including hosting, unlimited databases, user management, authentication, and analytics. Backend hosting is included in all plans, and users can deploy directly from the platform. Bolt also supports integration with third-party databases for advanced use cases.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Hostinger Horizons:</span> All plans include built-in backend hosting, with seamless deployment and domain management. Users do not need to manage separate hosting or backend infrastructure. The platform supports database integrations (e.g., Supabase, Firebase) for advanced data storage and authentication needs.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Base44:</span> Features an integrated backend and database system, with cloud hosting included in all plans. Backend functions are available on paid plans (Starter and above), while the free plan is limited to core features. Base44's backend is tightly coupled with its SDK, making migration to external hosting more complex, though self-hosting guides exist for advanced users.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Replit:</span> Provides browser-based hosting for both frontend and backend code. Users can deploy web apps, APIs, and bots directly from the platform. Replit supports custom domains and external deployment via code export, offering flexibility for both beginners and advanced developers.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">v0 (Vercel):</span> Focuses on frontend hosting via Vercel, with backend functionality achieved through integrations (e.g., Supabase, Convex, Firebase). Users must configure backend services separately, requiring some technical expertise. The platform excels at rapid frontend deployment but is less suited for backend-heavy applications without additional setup.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Analysis:</span> Hostinger Horizons, Base44, and Bolt offer the most seamless, all-in-one backend hosting experiences, ideal for non-technical users and rapid prototyping. Lovable and v0 provide greater flexibility through third-party integrations, catering to users who anticipate migrating or scaling beyond the platform. Replit stands out for its versatility, supporting both frontend and backend deployment with minimal friction. For projects requiring full-stack hosting without external dependencies, Hostinger Horizons and Base44 are top choices; for those prioritizing portability and extensibility, Lovable and v0 are preferable.</p>

    <h2 id="github">3. GitHub Integration Capabilities</h2>
    <p>GitHub integration is essential for version control, collaboration, and code portability. The leading vibe coding tools offer varying degrees of integration:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Lovable:</span> Provides two-way GitHub sync at the project level. Users can connect their Lovable project to a GitHub repository, enabling automatic backup, collaboration, and deployment. Edits in Lovable appear in GitHub and vice versa. The integration supports branch switching, pull requests, and local development. Exporting code requires a GitHub account, as Lovable pushes code to GitHub before users can download it as a ZIP file.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Bolt:</span> Features direct GitHub integration, handling all commit and update operations automatically. Users can create new repositories from Bolt projects, import existing repos, and manage branches. The integration is designed to be simple, with Bolt handling the complexities of Git for users. Collaboration and version control are streamlined, making it easy to switch between Bolt and GitHub workflows.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Hostinger Horizons:</span> Does not offer direct GitHub integration. Users cannot export code to GitHub or import from GitHub. The platform is designed for all-in-one, no-code development, prioritizing simplicity over advanced version control features. This limitation may hinder collaboration and code portability for teams or advanced users.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Base44:</span> Supports GitHub integration from the Builder plan ($40/mo) and above. Users can sync their projects with GitHub, enabling version control and collaboration. However, code export is limited to the frontend; backend logic remains tied to the Base44 SDK. The integration is valuable for teams and users planning to transition to custom development workflows.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Replit:</span> Offers comprehensive GitHub integration, including push/pull, version control, and collaboration. Users can connect their Replit projects to GitHub, manage branches, and synchronize changes. The integration supports both importing existing repos and exporting new projects, making it suitable for both solo developers and teams.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">v0 (Vercel):</span> Provides deep GitHub integration, allowing users to connect repositories, track changes, and enable automatic deployments. The integration supports version control, collaboration, CI/CD, and pull request previews. Vercel's GitHub integration is particularly strong for frontend projects, with seamless deployment and rollback capabilities.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Analysis:</span> Lovable, Bolt, Replit, and v0 offer robust GitHub integration, supporting both code export and collaborative workflows. Base44 provides integration on higher tiers, with some export limitations. Hostinger Horizons lags behind in this area, lacking direct GitHub support—a significant drawback for users who require version control or plan to migrate their projects. For professional teams and developers prioritizing code ownership and collaboration, platforms with strong GitHub integration are essential.</p>

    <h2 id="export">4. Full Project Code Download Availability (Free Tier)</h2>
    <p>Code export is a key concern for users seeking to avoid vendor lock-in, enable self-hosting, or collaborate with external developers. The platforms differ in their approach:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Lovable:</span> Allows full project code export via GitHub integration, even on the free tier. Users must connect a GitHub account, sync their project, and download the code as a ZIP from GitHub. The export includes frontend code (React/Next.js), but backend logic relies on external services (e.g., Supabase), which must be configured separately. The process is straightforward but requires basic GitHub familiarity. Some users report that exported code may need minor fixes before running independently.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Bolt:</span> Supports code export via GitHub on the free plan. Users can push their projects to GitHub and download the code for self-hosting or further development. The export includes both frontend and backend components, though backend setup may require additional configuration for advanced features. Bolt's export process is user-friendly and well-documented.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Hostinger Horizons:</span> Does not allow code export on the free trial.

    <h2 id="security">Security, Data Privacy, and IP Ownership</h2>
    <p>Security and data privacy are top concerns for organizations adopting vibe coding tools. Most platforms implement standard security features (e.g., authentication, encrypted storage, access controls), but the use of AI-generated code introduces new risks:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Code Quality and Security:</span> AI-generated code may contain vulnerabilities or fail to follow best practices. Studies show that up to 45% of AI-generated code samples fail security tests, including critical issues like cross-site scripting and log injection. Users should employ linters, security scans, and manual code reviews to mitigate risks.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Data Privacy:</span> Platforms like Lovable and Base44 offer options to opt out of data training on paid plans. Users should review privacy policies and ensure sensitive data is not exposed in prompts or exported code.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">IP Ownership:</span> Generally, users retain ownership of the code and projects they create, but platform terms may grant the provider a license to host or display public projects. Exported code can be self-hosted and licensed as desired. Legal frameworks for AI-generated works are still evolving; users should seek legal advice for mission-critical or commercial projects.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Best Practices:</span> Use version control (GitHub), test and debug after each change, run code through linters, and consider hybrid approaches (e.g., professional code review) for production deployments. Maintain clear documentation and track all changes for auditability and compliance.</p>

    <h2 id="migration">Migration and Vendor Lock-In Risks</h2>
    <p>Vendor lock-in is a significant risk, especially for platforms that restrict backend export or tie critical logic to proprietary SDKs. Key considerations include:</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Lovable:</span> Supports frontend code export and third-party backend integration, reducing lock-in risk. Backend setup for self-hosting requires manual configuration of environment variables and services (e.g., Supabase).</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Base44:</span> Backend logic is tightly coupled with the Base44 SDK, making migration complex. Self-hosting guides and universal SDKs exist for advanced users, but full independence requires technical effort.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Hostinger Horizons:</span> Lacks code export on the free tier and restricts backend access, increasing lock-in risk. Users seeking long-term ownership should consider platforms with more flexible export options.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Bolt, Replit, v0:</span> Support code export and external deployment, minimizing lock-in. Users can migrate projects to other platforms or self-host as needed.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Recommendation:</span> For projects with long-term or commercial goals, prioritize platforms with robust code export, GitHub integration, and clear migration paths. Document all dependencies and consider professional migration services for complex transitions.</p>
